    [Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now, I don't wanna wake up

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind (Yeah)
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasin'
You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(Uh-huh)

[Chorus: Kali Uchis & Tyler, The Creator]
Can I get a kiss? (Ah)
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (Uh-huh)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okey-dokey, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of, what you call it? (Love)
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I ain't met you, I've been lookin'
Stop the waitin' 'fore I stop the chasin', like a alcoholic
"You don't understand me" – What the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah, it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar-honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Ugh

[Pre-Chorus: Tyler, The Creator, Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydream, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
So

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
[Outro: Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—
(La-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Okay, okay, okay, okay, o—
(La-la-la, la-la—)
One more time?
